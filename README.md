# Genetic Navigation

The Genetic Navigation aims to learn a navigational robot controller through a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach.

## Genetic Algorithm

The GA is generically implemented to provide an interface for user-defined solution encodings and individual representations. The framework currently supports the following features:

- Selection
  - Tournament Selection
- Recombination
  - Single Point Crossover
  - Multi-Point Crossover
- Mutation

## Getting Started

To get started, see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/andersonjwan/genetic-navigation/wiki/Getting-Started) wikipage available for details on downloading, building, and running the examples.
