Welcome to Genetic Navigation's documentation!
==============================================

The *Genetic Navigation* uses a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to learn a **controller**
for a wheeled mobile robot in order to successfully navigate in an environment.
The objective is for the robot to reach a goal location while avoiding
collisions with obstacles.

For more information on Genetic Algorithms, please visit the :doc:`genetic_algos` section.
